:::Overview:::

Futuristic sci-fi racing game at its core, where instead of racing being the pure focus, an array of challenges are presented to the player per track.

These challenges can be collection achievements, stunt challenges, time trials, "avoid damage" challenges, races, escorts, and platforming. For each completed challenge, the player is awarded a key point (name and aesthetic open to alignment). These key points can be used to unlock new tracks.

Different types of collectible currencies are found throughout the stage and can be obtained by destroying enemies (via ramming, derailing, or through special skills [not yet defined])

At the start of each track, a lap counter begins and counts down. Upon completing the final lap, the counter resets to the maximum laps for the track and all uncompleted challenges are cleared/reset. Cleared challenges are compiled and points are awarded. 

The player can exit to the garage via the pause menu at any time.

The garage is the hub world, where the player can spend earned currencies to buy modifications to their ships, create new ships, modify their character's appearance, unlock companions and abilities, and more.

Story advancement takes place by completing a minimum number of challenges per track, and by completing a minimum number of tracks. For example, if there are three tracks in the first story sequence, you may need 3/10 completed achievements for each track before the story will allow you to progress. 

This is the game's core gameplay loop, and we can always expand upon this core by adding new tracks, more challenges in each track, and more unlockables. 


:::Storyline:::

[all characters, themes, and terms are subject to change with aesthetic, art, character, and world-building direction from the team]


Cutscene opens with a discussion occurring between two characters. One is a larger, almost deity-like presence, the other is a small nonhuman familiar. The deity presence explains that the veil between realms is fading, that the kingdom is in great danger, and that an unknown evil force behind all of this seeks power of its own. When the veil fades, the deity can no longer protect its realm. A mortal hero must be chosen to take up arms in a last-ditch effort to stop the rise of the unknown evil. The familiar acknowledges this and kneels before the deity. The familiar is granted a small blessing and departs to summon the hero.

The next cutscene begins with a dark, nightmare world track. Lots of tension as the hero character (in a formless shadow avatar form) struggles to outrun and avoid demonic enemy racers. A large tower with a bright blue beacon shines in the distance as we race towards it. The familiar/helper character shows up in this dream to pause time and tutorialize the game for the player. The player has controls and gameplay mechanics explained to them, time is unfrozen, and looped until the player succeeds. They move on to the next tutorial from there until the basics are all explained. 

After the final tutorial, a boss enemy appears and begins to chase the hero down in a highly tense moment. The familiar's time-stop powers no longer work and they are simply along for the ride now. As the hero races away from the boss, towards the tower, they begin to hear reverberant/ethereal cries for help from the queen. They are told to light the two emerald beacons to open the path to the sapphire tower. The tower fades into the distance like a mirage and the boss barrels in over the hero, ending in blackness. The veil has severed all ties with the world's guardian deity. 

The hero awakens (from their first person perspective) in a mechanic shop, the familiar taunting them. "I thought you were faster than that!" and similar jabs, in addition to a less dark interior and calm music should create a lighthearted atmosphere. 
Familiar/hero introductions take place as the character creation engine allows the player to build their base character. The familiar also explains how your soul was plucked from the dreamworld ("something like heaven but way more disappointing") for the purpose of saving the kingdom.

Enter: the mechanic, a grouchy but not-so-serious person that explains how they've heard the whole "grand tales of saving the world" a few times now and they're just along for the ride at this point. I can see this character as being a good source of meta-narrative comic relief. You're treated to your first basic starter ship and a simple tutorial on how to use the garage, before the familiar reminds you of the "two emerald towers" that you must light to unlock the path to the sapphire tower to warn the queen of what is to come. "Luckily this place isn't too big, let's get going!". The mechanic pulls a dusty cover off of a nearby console and hits it with a wrench, turning it on. This is your track-select screen. The mechanic explain vaguely how they swear they've seen stuff like this before. Like it's deja vu or something. They ask you if you've done all this already, your character shrugs.


It is at this point that the game becomes open for the player to tackle the track and its challenges. The familiar explains that the next objective is to collect x of y challenge points to be able to fix the track selection console and navigate to the other tracks. The first track has no beacons, but the 2nd track does. The tower can only be lit when x of y challenges for that 2nd track, and a story sequence takes place where the tower is lit with the challenge points.

This is where the hero looks confused, and the familiar acknowledges their expressions of doubt. How it seems odd that we are following the vague directions of a dream the hero was pulled from. How this feels like it's all a prophecy fulfillment on rails. 

The hero moves to the 3rd track to light the last emerald beacon.
The next set of challenges are completed, and when the hero needs 1 more challenge point to light the beacon, an event flag is triggered. 

It is at this point that they are overrun by a mysterious racer who taunts them and eggs them on like a rival. An optional race challenge appears and the hero can choose to race this character. If they win, they unlock the character in versus/co-op and appearances for their ship and custom character. They also obtain a challenge point for winning and now have enough to light the beacon. The hero can complete any other challenge to get enough points, however, making this race optional. 

After you light the beacon, this mysterious rival is confronted and they tell you that they'll warn the queen before you can. That they'll be the hero. 

The 4th track is the path to the Sapphire Tower, and it should appear like the tower is always a mirage in the distance for you. This entire track should feel like a floating dream, to ensure that you are always somehow moving towards the tower, but still looping around on yourself. Once its challenges are completed, you find yourself automatically advancing the story. 

The Sapphire Tower track starts to collapse in on itself [this part may or may not be playable, it could be a cutscene only depending on scope], but this serves as the point of downfall/descent and initial failure to the hero. Both the hero and rival race side by side as the track splits and merges like a maze and darkness envelopes it. The rival shouts via comms "what have we done?? will we ever be forgiven?!" and ships merge into a black hole, as they fall and look back, we see the tower broken apart by light in the distance as we cross the threshold and are time-stop/ripped into nothingness. 

:: ACT II: Return ::

A long pause of blackness, a small boot sequence appears on screen. Diagnostics take place, with lots of errors. Simulacra.exe kicks off, and the hud disappears with a shimmer across the screen (still in blackness). There is a rumbling and lots of noisy rustling.

You awaken to heaps of sand and abandoned ships as you discover you've been dumped into a giant junkyard alongside mangled droid parts, rusted equipment, and strange magical looking gear. A tiny scavenger droid hits you in the head from offscreen and they apologize, realizing that you've awakened. "Just testing your head's durability! I was gonna use it!"

The droid recognizes you are damaged and brings you to his shop, where you see the mechanic from before. But this time, they do not recognize you at all and are far more eccentric and gone. Their mannerisms are erratic and they speak of ships and junkyard parts in biblical stylings. It is unclear at this point if they are even the same mechanic from before, and nobody can seem to answer how they got here or where they are. The power in the shop goes out and the Mechanic tasks the droid with making you seem useful. Challenge points are now power points, and you are given a basic ship to go and collect points.

The junkyard track is the next area where you tackle challenges. The same game loop exists as before, but some new mechanics are introduced [possibly weapons and special upgrades]. You discover through story beats that this world has been a blighted junk heap for eons, and that the old kingdom was destroyed long ago. An extremely long track that rapidly turns up 90 degrees and disappears into the clouds lines the horizon like a monolith.

After collecting enough power points, you return to the shop and power it back up, illuminating more of the shop than before. The mechanic also uses the power points to fix parts of your memory bank. You see the wall painting/mural and its an image of your old ship, dashing alongside your rival towards the sapphire tower and you remember what happened. You explain this to the mechanic, who jumps excitedly, speaking that the chosen one has returned to complete what was foiled. The mechanic tasks you with venturing throughout the junkyards and adjacent tracks to gather all the necessary parts to build the master ship, per the historical plans. They explain that it would have been nearly impossible to build without your help and ability to pilot it, and that it is a time machine that can return to the point of divergence to save the old kingdom. 

You will discover and build new ships along the way, and you can ultimately choose one to grant "master ship" powers to, to take back with you to undo what was done. 

::: Final Act: Ascension :::

This cutscene is a massive shift in tone as the mechanic opens the mural like doors, bows at you, and a pathway to the underground appears and you are set on your journey. You race your ship down an extremely long track, hitting boosts and going beyond top speed while you hear memories of the queen's voices. It all merges onto the sharp upturn, and you rocket up the track into the sky and enter the white hole, returning to the world you left. 

This time, the world is dark, empty, and quiet. You move along the Sapphire track as it turns into that looping dream track from where you were pulled. You hear a voice that you've heard before, and it's your familiar. 

This time, you realize the familiar has a more sinister tone. The familiar explains that it was the evil force that tricked the guardian deity into granting it power to pull a hero from itself. The familiar explains that the queen was just an avatar of the entire kingdom's hive consciousness, and that the evil force was born out of a need to balance against the purity of the kingdom. All of the kingdom's doubts, fears, and anxieties sparked the evil force and gave it life apart from them all. 

You race/battle the final boss on the track and if you fail - you are cast back into the junkyard realm. "Scavenge some more, you're not worthy of the truth yet."

If you succeed, the familiar departs like a mist, and you find yourself atop the Sapphire tower, which had been shrouded by darkness before. Before you, you see your rival from before and they congratulate you on returning the darkness back to the source. The rival explains that they are the queen, and that you were part of a failsafe program to ensure that all darkness gets returned to the core consciousness for processing. As you are about to be dismissed, you wave your arm demanding an explanation.

"We are everything, and we tell the story we want to hear. You are a part of that story, and your chapter has come to a close."

Every part of you is folded in on itself and the ship, absorbed as energy into the Queen. The guardian deity returns. The queen says "purification complete" and the deity bows in a way that you recognize.
